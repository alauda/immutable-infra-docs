# Node Disruption Policies

## Understanding Node Disruption in Machine Configuration

By default, when you make certain changes to the `systemd` units section of a `MachineConfig` object, the Machine Configuration Operator will drain and reboot the nodes associated with that `MachineConfig`. However, changes to regular file entries typically do **not** cause a reboot, which may result in the configuration not taking effect as expected. To address this, you can define node disruption policies to specify which types of changes should trigger node reboots or other disruption actions. These policies are configured in the `MachineConfiguration` object located in the `cpaas-system` namespace. See the example below for configuring a node disruption policy.

Once defined, the Machine Configuration Operator validates the policy to detect issues such as invalid formatting. Then, it populates the policy into the `status.nodeDisruptionPolicyStatus` field of the `MachineConfiguration` object. These user-defined policies override the cluster's default disruption settings.

A default `MachineConfiguration` custom resource named `cluster` is installed with the cluster. You can configure node disruption behavior on this resource.

## What You Can Control with Node Disruption Policies

Node disruption policies allow you to define what happens when changes are made to the following configuration areas:

* **Files**: You can define behavior for file changes (excluding changes to the root directory). By default, file changes do not trigger any disruption. You can modify this behavior using the `spec.defaultNodeDisruptionPolicySpecAction.files` field.

* **Systemd Units**: You can create or modify `systemd` services, including enabling, disabling, or changing their state. By default, changes to `systemd` units trigger a node drain and reboot.

* **SSH Public Keys**: You can add or update SSH keys for the `boot` user. These changes are applied immediately by default and do not trigger a reboot or drain.

Each change is evaluated against the node disruption policy, which can trigger one or more of the following actions:

* `Reboot`: Drain and reboot the node.
* `None`: No disruption is triggered; the change is applied silently.
* `Drain`: Drain the node without rebooting.
* `Restart`: Restart the specified `systemd` service.
* `DaemonReload`: Reload all `systemd` unit configurations.

## Example: Default Node Disruption Policy

The following is the default configuration for the `cluster` `MachineConfiguration` resource after installation:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNodeDisruptionPolicySpecAction:
    files:
    - type: None
    units:
    - type: Reboot
  nodeDisruptionPolicy:
    sshkey:
      actions:
      - type: None
```

This configuration means:

* File changes trigger no action.
* Systemd unit changes cause a node drain and reboot.
* SSH key changes are applied without disruption.

---

## Example: Customizing File Behavior

You can change the default action for file changes to trigger a reboot:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNodeDisruptionPolicySpecAction:
    files:
    - type: Reboot
    units:
    - type: Reboot
  nodeDisruptionPolicy:
    sshkey:
      actions:
      - type: None
```

With this configuration, any change to a managed file will cause the Machine Configuration Operator to drain and reboot the affected node.

---

## Example: Applying Policy to a Specific File

You can also define disruption actions for a specific file path. In the following example, changes to `/usr/local/bin/myapp.sh` will not trigger a node reboot, but instead reload the systemd configuration and restart the related service:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNodeDisruptionPolicySpecAction:
    files:
    - type: Reboot
    units:
    - type: Reboot
  nodeDisruptionPolicy:
    files:
    - path: /usr/local/bin/myapp.sh
      actions:
      - type: DaemonReload
      - type: Restart
        restart:
          serviceName: myapp.service
    sshkey:
      actions:
      - type: None
```

In this case, when `/usr/local/bin/myapp.sh` is updated, the Machine Configuration Operator will reload all `systemd` units and restart the `myapp.service`â€”without draining or rebooting the node.
