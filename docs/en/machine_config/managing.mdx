# Managing Node Configuration

You can use the tasks described in this section to create `MachineConfig` objects that modify files, systemd units, and SSH public keys on nodes, as well as to recover nodes that have experienced configuration drift.

`MachineConfig` supports Ignition specification version 3.4. All `MachineConfig` objects must be created in compliance with this version.

In certain situations, the configuration on a node may not fully match the configuration currently applied through the `MachineConfig`. This condition is referred to as configuration drift. The machine configuration daemon periodically verifies whether a node's configuration has drifted. If drift is detected, the node is marked as `Degraded` and remains in that state until an administrator restores the expected configuration.

The following examples demonstrate how to use `MachineConfig` objects to manage node configurations.

## Configuring the Chrony Time Service

To configure the Chrony time synchronization service (`chronyd`) and specify the NTP servers and related settings, you can update the `chrony.conf` file on the target nodes via a `MachineConfig` object.

1. First, create a temporary file that contains the desired Chrony configuration:

   ```text
   chrony.conf
   server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
   server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
   makestep 1.0 3
   rtcsync
   logdir /var/log/chrony
   ```

2. Then, base64-encode the contents of the file:

   ```bash
   base64 -w0 chrony.conf
   ```

3. Create a `MachineConfig` object named `99-worker-chrony`. In the `.spec.config.storage.files[0].contents.source` field, insert the base64-encoded string in the format `data:text/plain;base64,<encoded-content>`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: machineconfiguration.alauda.io/v1alpha1
   kind: MachineConfig
   metadata:
     name: 99-worker-chrony
     labels:
       machineconfiguration.alauda.io/role: worker
   spec:
     config:
       ignition:
         version: 3.4.0
       storage:
         files:
           - path: /etc/chrony.conf
             mode: 0644
             contents:
               source: 'data:text/plain;base64,c2VydmVyIDAuY2VudG9zLnBvb2wubnRwLm9yZyBpYnVyc3QKc2VydmVyIDEuY2VudG9zLnBvb2wubnRwLm9yZyBpYnVyc3QKbWFrZXN0ZXAgMS4wIDMKcnRjc3luYwpsb2dkaXIgL3Zhci9sb2cvY2hyb255Cg=='
   ```

   This configuration creates a `MachineConfig` object that applies a customized `chrony.conf` file to nodes associated with the `worker` machine configuration pool. The file will be written to `/etc/chrony.conf` on each node, with file permissions set to `0644`.

## Disabling the Chrony Time Service

To disable the Chrony time synchronization service on nodes with a specific role, you can create a `MachineConfig` object that overrides the systemd unit definition and disables the service.

Example configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 99-worker-disable-chrony
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.alauda.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.4.0
    systemd:
      units:
        - name: chronyd.service
          enabled: false
          contents: |
            [Unit]
            Description=NTP client/server
            Documentation=man:chronyd(8) man:chrony.conf(5)
            After=ntpdate.service sntp.service ntpd.service
            Conflicts=ntpd.service systemd-timesyncd.service
            ConditionCapability=CAP_SYS_TIME

            [Service]
            Type=forking
            PIDFile=/run/chrony/chronyd.pid
            EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/chronyd
            ExecStart=/usr/sbin/chronyd $OPTIONS
            ExecStartPost=/usr/libexec/chrony-helper update-daemon
            PrivateTmp=yes
            ProtectHome=yes
            ProtectSystem=full

            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This configuration pushes a custom version of the `chronyd.service` unit file to the nodes in the `worker` machine configuration pool. The service is explicitly disabled. Once the configuration is applied and the nodes are rebooted, the Chrony service will no longer start automatically.

## Configuring the SSH Public Key for the `boot` User

The machine configuration system allows you to configure an SSH public key for the `boot` user on managed nodes. Configuration for other user accounts is not supported. Note that machine configuration will not create users or groups automaticallyâ€”you must ensure that the `boot` user and group exist on the node before applying the configuration.

Example configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 99-worker-ssh
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.alauda.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.4.0
    passwd:
      users:
        - user: boot
          sshAuthorizedKeys:
            - ssh-rsa <ssh-public-key>
```

This `MachineConfig` will install the specified SSH key in the `/home/boot/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on nodes in the `worker` machine configuration pool.

## Recovering from Configuration Drift

If a node's configuration diverges from its assigned `MachineConfig`, it will be marked as `Degraded`. In this state, the node continues to operate but cannot receive further configuration updates until the issue is resolved.

There are two ways to restore a node from this degraded state:

1. **Manually revert the configuration**
   You can manually adjust the files and permissions on the node to exactly match those specified in the assigned `MachineConfig`. The system will detect the correction and clear the degraded status.

2. **Force the configuration to be reapplied**
   Create an empty file at `/run/machine-config-daemon-force` on the affected node. The machine configuration daemon will detect this trigger, reapply the current `MachineConfig`, delete the trigger file, and reboot the node. After rebooting, the node will transition from `Degraded` back to `Done`.
