# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **Immutable Infrastructure** on the <Term name="product" textCase="capitalize" /> platform. This solution provides a comprehensive, declarative approach to managing Kubernetes clusters using Cluster API.

**Immutable Infrastructure Principles**:

- **Declarative Configuration**: All infrastructure is defined as code
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are tracked and versioned
- **Reproducible Deployments**: Consistent environments across different deployments
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollback to previous infrastructure states
