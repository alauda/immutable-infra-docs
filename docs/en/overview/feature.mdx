# Feature Overview

The Immutable Infrastructure support provides comprehensive cluster and cloud infrastructure management capabilities designed for enterprise-grade Kubernetes deployments. This platform leverages advanced automation and infrastructure-as-code principles to deliver reliable, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure solutions.

## Cluster Management

Our platform offers end-to-end Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management with immutable OS principles, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments across environments.

### Cluster Creation
- **Immutable OS Support**: Create clusters using immutable OS patterns for enhanced security and consistency
- **Automated Compute Provisioning**: Automatic provisioning of compute instances with pre-configured specifications
- **Bootstrap Automation**: Automated cluster bootstrapping with minimal manual intervention

### Cluster Deletion
- **Complete Resource Cleanup**: Comprehensive deletion process that removes all associated resources
- **Provider Resource Release**: Proper deallocation of provider resources to prevent orphaned instances

### Cluster Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add or remove worker nodes to meet workload demands
- **Automated Compute Management**: Automatic creation and release of compute instances during scaling operations
- **Zero-Downtime Scaling**: Scale operations without service interruption

### Cluster Upgrades
- **Kubernetes Version Management**: Seamless upgrades to newer Kubernetes versions

## Supported Infrastructure Providers

Our platform follows a pluggable provider model aligned with Cluster API infrastructure providers. It is designed for multiple infrastructure platforms. Today, the DCS infrastructure provider is supported, with additional providers in progress.

- **Provider-Agnostic Design**: Core workflows are consistent across providers
- **Current Support**: DCS infrastructure provider
- **Roadmap**: Additional providers are being added

## Compute Resource Management

Advanced virtual machine lifecycle management with enterprise-grade features for optimal resource utilization and performance.

### Compute Lifecycle Operations
- **Create Compute Instances**: Provision instances with customizable specifications and configurations
- **Delete Compute Instances**: Secure deletion with proper resource cleanup

### Compute Configuration Options
- **Instance/Flavor Selection**: Choose from predefined instance types or flavors optimized for different workloads
- **Size Customization**: Flexible sizing options from small development instances to large production workloads
- **Resource Allocation**: Precise control over CPU, memory, and storage allocation
- **Network Configuration**: Advanced networking options including custom subnets and security groups
- **Storage Options**: Multiple storage types and classes (for example: SSD, HDD, NVMe) for different performance requirements
