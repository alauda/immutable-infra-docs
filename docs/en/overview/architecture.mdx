# Architecture

## Overview

Our immutable infrastructure platform is built on the Cluster API (CAPI) framework, providing a declarative, Kubernetes-native approach to cluster lifecycle management.

## Architecture Components

### Core Cluster API Framework

The platform is built around the Cluster API framework, which provides:

- **Declarative API**: Kubernetes-native resources for cluster management
- **Provider Interface**: Standardized interfaces for different infrastructure providers
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated cluster provisioning, scaling, and upgrades
- **GitOps Integration**: Native support for GitOps workflows

### Provider Architecture

Our platform integrates three key Cluster API providers:

#### 1. Bootstrap Provider - Kubeadm

The **Cluster API Bootstrap Provider Kubeadm** handles the initialization and configuration of Kubernetes nodes:

- **Node Initialization**: Automates the process of turning bare machines into Kubernetes nodes
- **Configuration Management**: Manages kubelet configuration, certificates, and bootstrap tokens
- **Join Process**: Handles the process of joining worker nodes to the cluster
- **Certificate Management**: Automates certificate generation and rotation

#### 2. Control Plane Provider - Kubeadm

The **Cluster API Control Plane Provider Kubeadm** manages the Kubernetes control plane:

- **Control Plane Deployment**: Deploys and manages the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and control plane components
- **High Availability**: Supports multi-node control plane deployments with load balancing
- **Upgrade Management**: Handles rolling upgrades of control plane components
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitors control plane health and performs recovery operations

#### 3. Infrastructure Provider

The chosen **Infrastructure Provider** (our custom provider such as DCS) manages the underlying infrastructure for the target platform:

- **Compute Provisioning**: Creates and manages virtual machines or instances on the target platform
- **Network Configuration**: Sets up networking infrastructure
- **Resource Management**: Manages compute, storage, and network resources
- **Provider Integration**: Integrates with the provider's APIs and services
